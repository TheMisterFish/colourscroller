# Colourscroller

A Fabric mod that makes cycling through related items fast and intuitive. Use configurable keys to scroll a single selected item through its color/type variants or to scroll your entire hotbar so all matching item types change together.

## Goal

Enable quick in-game cycling of item colours and related variants. Scroll a single held item through its variant sequence, or synchronize an entire hotbar row so all items of the same family update to the same variant.

## Required library

**This mod required MaliLib to function**

You can find the MaliLib library [on modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/malilib).
## Features

* Scroll a single selected item through its colour or variant chain while preserving NBT and stack size.
* Scroll an entire hotbar row so every item that belongs to the same family (wool, stained glass, concrete, walls/slabs/stairs, etc.) updates to match the currently selected variant.
* Works across different block families and combinations of block types.
* Fully configurable key bindings and behavior.

## How to Use

* Bind keys in your controls for: Base Key, Scroll Row, Scroll Single.
* To scroll, hold the Base Key then press the Scroll Row key or the Scroll Single key while using the mouse wheel or keyboard scroll input to move to the next variant.
* If Base Key is unbound, it is optional and you can use Scroll Row or Scroll Single alone.
* Scroll Single: cycles only the selected item (keeps NBT and count). Example: white wool -> light gray wool -> gray wool.
* Scroll Row: finds all items in your hotbar that share the same family as the selected item and sets them to the same variant you scrolled to. Example: selected white concrete; stained glass, wool, and powdered concrete in the hotbar will also change to the corresponding shade.

## Default Key Bindings

* Base Key: Left Ctrl + Left (default)
* Scroll Row: C (default)
* Scroll Single: X (default)

## Examples

* Hold Base Key + X and scroll while holding white wool to cycle only that stack through wool colours; the stack count and NBT stay the same.
* Hold Base Key + C and scroll while selecting white concrete; your hotbar’s stained glass, wool, and powdered concrete become the same shade.
